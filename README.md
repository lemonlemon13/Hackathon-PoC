:(){:|:&};: [HACKATHON] :(){:|:&};:

Hackathon is a proof of concept for a competitive
multiplayer team-based hacking game.

Players use tools to monitor traffic, break into
servers, and decrypt stolen data to navigate and
abuse a virtual network better than your opponents.


The game is currently at version 0.1.1 and very
early in development (there isn't even a GUI yet
it's just a chat room right now).
