---MAJOR RELEASE---

v1 (21/11/2024): Hello, World!
The first version. Wrote the code for the Clients/Server to talk to each other and connect via a generated room code. Not much else to say.
Have a rough idea on what to develop this into but is prone to change.

---MINOR RELEASE---

v1.1 (29/11/2024): Refactor Update
I've written a mock-up of what this project is going to become, but first some house keeping before getting started properly.

Added:
- Added a Hackathon.py file that combines both Server and Client functionality.

Changed:
- Server.py now gets the host's IP address by itself instead of it being manually inputted beforehand.
- RoomCode class renamed to LobbyCode to avoid confusion for planned potential RoomCode class.
- Refactored the Server and Client files to to be a tad more modular and make more sense to be called as functions.

- Currently working on adding a GUI after hosting/joining a lobby via tkinter.
- Still early in development, anything is subject to change, everything might be only in the Terminal.

v2-002 (2/12/2024): GUI Update
- Minor changes to versioning convention.
- Added TODO list element to add a fake boot-up animation to mariOS.
- Added Server Manager script to know what state the server is in and for potential easier connections between clients.
- Removing plans for a text editor or web browser, they were too GUI-ey and I'm deciding to stick exclusively to the terminal.

v2-003 (3/12/2024): GUI Update
- Added short descriptions for each script.

- Specifying new types of messages (for the PreGame chat and for new clients).

- Added something at all to ServerManager.py.
- Started to rewrite parts of Server.py and Client.py to incorporate the GameMsg class.

v2-005 (6/12/2024): GUI Update
- Finished re-writing enough to make the pre-game chat work again. Still need to add ServerManager class functionality.
- chatLog renamed to preGameLog.
- Fixed a bug regarding the RNG class requiring a seed instead of having None as a default.

v2-X (10/12/2024): GUI Update
- Added functionality to allow the host of the server (the first person that joins) to be able to start the game which will open the GUI interface and stop the pregame chat.
- Added a boot animation when the given command is 'reboot'.
