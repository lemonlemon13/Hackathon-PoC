v0.1.0 (21/11/2024): Hello, World!
The first version. Wrote the code for the Clients/Server to talk to each other and connect via a generated room code. Not much else to say.
Have a rough idea on what to develop this into but is prone to change.

v0.1.1 (29/11/2024): Refactor Update
I've written a mock-up of what this project is going to become, but first some house keeping before getting started properly.

Added:
- Added a Hackathon.py file that combines both Server and Client functionality.

Changed:
- Server.py now gets the host's IP address by itself instead of it being manually inputted beforehand.
- RoomCode class renamed to LobbyCode to avoid confusion for planned potential RoomCode class.
- Refactored the Server and Client files to to be a tad more modular and make more sense to be called as functions.
