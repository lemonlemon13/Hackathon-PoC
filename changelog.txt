---MAJOR RELEASE---

v1 (21/11/2024): Hello, World!
The first version. Wrote the code for the Clients/Server to talk to each other and connect via a generated room code. Not much else to say.
Have a rough idea on what to develop this into but is prone to change.

---MINOR RELEASE---

v1.1 (29/11/2024): Refactor Update
I've written a mock-up of what this project is going to become, but first some house keeping before getting started properly.

Added:
- Added a Hackathon.py file that combines both Server and Client functionality.

Changed:
- Server.py now gets the host's IP address by itself instead of it being manually inputted beforehand.
- RoomCode class renamed to LobbyCode to avoid confusion for planned potential RoomCode class.
- Refactored the Server and Client files to to be a tad more modular and make more sense to be called as functions.

---BETA---

v2-001 (30/11/2024): GUI Update
- Currently working on adding a GUI after hosting/joining a lobby via tkinter.
- Still early in development, anything is subject to change, everything might be only in the Terminal.

v2-002 (2/12/2024): GUI Update
- Minor changes to versioning convention.
- Added TODO list element to add a fake boot-up animation to mariOS.
- Added Server Manager script to know what state the server is in and for potential easier connections between clients.
- Removing plans for a text editor or web browser, they were too GUI-ey and I'm deciding to stick exclusively to the terminal.

v2-003 (3/12/2024): GUI Update
- Added short descriptions for each script.
- Added NetworkArch.py for data types used by both Servers and Clients.
- Still working on stuff (mostly pre-game lobby).

v2-004 (5/12/2024): GUI Update
- Minor Tweaks to the TODO List to remove scrapped content.
- Specifying new types of messages (for the PreGame chat and for new clients).
- Added a RNG() class to CryptoTools.py that will handle generating random numbers.
- Added something at all to ServerManager.py.
- Started to rewrite parts of Server.py and Client.py to incorporate the GameMsg class.
